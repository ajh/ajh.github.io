# motions like [[ and [m

See `:help motion.txt`

There's a bunch of motions and they won't all be listed.

| command  | description         |
| ---      | -------             |
| `[[` | |
| `]] | |
| `[m | |
| `]m | |

# My Misc plugin

See `:help TBD`

# TODO

* my vim plugins
* mkview and loadview for keeping folds on a file

Questions:
* Why does indent-object only work to select text in visual mode? But
  the ruby plugin adds motions like [m. Are they interchangable?
